# Breast Cancer Classifier

## Overview

This project is a machine learning model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant based on patient characteristics. The model is trained using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which contains 569 samples of biopsied breast cells. Each sample has 30 characteristics, such as radius, texture, and smoothness, that are used to determine the diagnosis.
